# Sin() and Cos()
Graphing Sine and Cosine trigonometric function in Javascript

Way back when I was about 14 or 15, before I knew anything about math and was just getting started coding I saw the built in functions  sin() and cos().  Plotting them on the screen led me to the questions "what is sin()?", "what is cos()", and "why does the relationship between them draw a circle?"  These questions fascinated me and inspired me to learn more about math and about programming.  This facination lead me to minor in applied mathamatics, and pursue a masters program in computer science followed by a long and successfull career in software.  Here here is a very simple javascript program that mimics my explorations into sin() and cos() as a kid.
