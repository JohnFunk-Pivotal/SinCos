# Sin() and Cos()
Graphing Sine and Cosine trigonometric function in Javascript - See it run at http://www.johnfunk.com/SinAndCos.html

Way back when I was about 14 or 15, before I knew anything about math and was just getting started coding I saw the built in functions  sin() and cos().  Plotting them on the screen led me to the questions "what is sin()?, what is cos(), and why does the relationship between them draw a circle"?   These questions sparked facination in my young mind and inspired me to learn more about math and about programming.  Over time this facination with math and computer science lead me to minor in applied mathamatics and the pursue of a masters degree in computer science followed by a long and successfull career in the software industry.  

Here here is a very simple javascript program that mimics my explorations into sin() and cos() as a kid.  May it inspire generations to come!
